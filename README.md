# Gradebook-generation-using-Abstract-Factory-Design-Pattern

Used abstract factory design pattern to create a software which generates the gradebook of undergrad and graduate students.

Data for undergraduate students was parsed from JSON file and from XML file for graduate students.

Created reading factory and printing factories as Abstract Factory using different interfaces to interact with different objects.

Special instructions:
 Input files are present in the project structure.
 The relative path for input files is hardcoded in the program.
 So to test against other input files just replace the files with same name as already present.
 All the output files for graduate and undergraduate students in XML, CSV and HTML format are inside the project structure.
 To run the program run mainClass.java
